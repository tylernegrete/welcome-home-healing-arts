    <h1>WELCOME</h1>
    <p>Hi there, friend! Welcome to the internet home of my offerings :) I'm happy you're here! 
    Energy healing has been such a profound part of my healing journey, and I'm really passionate about offering it to people. 
    I find it to be such a powerful way to heal and grow. I'm so happy to be here to offer you a sacred, heart-centered space where we can work together to further your healing journey. 
    I find it potent and love to weave energy healing and massage together, listening to my intuition and any guidance from your higher self to facilitate deep healing of energy within your body and mind. 
    My intention is always to let my love flow through my practice and guide me along the way as I let my intuition flow and trust. 
    I have many other healing modalities I like to weave in if they are called as well, such as the Ho'oh Pono Pono prayer or Internal Family Systems parts work. 
    If you'd like to learn more about the four energy healing modalities I'm attuned to and what I'm offering, please click the video below! Love you!</p>
