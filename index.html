      <h2>Testimonials</h2>

      <blockquote class="quote">
        “Tyler is an extraordinary healer and a deeply intuitive guide. He is lighthearted and playful, his heart is pure, and his spiritual wisdom runs deep. He speaks truth with clarity and compassion, making his guidance easy to receive and integrate.
        The healing frequencies that move through him are profoundly powerful—truly beyond words. They must be experienced to be understood.
        Working with Tyler is both grounding and expansive. I feel safe, seen, and deeply supported in his presence, and I trust him completely to walk with me on my healing journey.”

      <blockquote class="quote">
        “I met Tyler at an energy healing circle, and immediately felt comfortable in his presence. He brings such an open heart and grounded energy into his practice that makes you feel at ease and safe. Tyler has this intuitive gift of knowing what you need in that moment of his energy work. This gift and his open-hearted presence helps transmute any lower energies, aligning your energy with love and helps bring you into an open-hearted presence of grounded peace and inner alignment. It's truly a gift to receive his healing energy!”

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="quote">
        “When you look for energy work, the energy & intention of the practitioner is paramount. Tyler is full of love & tenderness & compassion, which is an outpouring of love for humanity & life at large. (Not a creepy, ego-driven, ‘shaman’ who wants your money & your devotion—you may know & fear the type).
        He has developed his practice through a unique/personal mix of traditions & insight/inner work. The blessings he has given me have connected me to/put me in touch with an ancient, powerful, confident version of myself that had been lost/was not so present within me.
        And his work absolutely arises from/is connected to your being, which means he is coming to you with presence—co-creating your healing with you/personalizing your experience.
        Love & healing to you all.”

        “Tyler is a natural healer. His loving presence and ability to connect to divine healing energy is profound. I have had the lucky opportunity to work with and alongside Tyler many times. He has always been a grounding and loving presence to the community he serves as well as for myself. Anyone with the lucky opportunity to work with Tyler will no doubt experience his extraordinary healing gifts and loving heart.”
