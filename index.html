        <p>Hi there, friend! Welcome to the internet home of my offerings :) I'm happy you're here!</p>
        <p>Energy healing has been such a profound part of my healing journey, and I'm really passionate about offering it to people. I find it to be such a powerful way to heal and grow.</p>
        <p>I'm so happy to be here to offer you a sacred, heart-centered space where we can work together to further your healing journey. I find it potent and love to weave energy healing and massage together, listening to my intuition and any guidance from your higher self to facilitate deep healing of energy within your body and mind. My intention is always to let my love flow through my practice and guide me along the way as I let my intuition flow and trust. I have many other healing modalities I like to weave in if they are called as well, such as the Ho'oh Pono Pono prayer or Internal Family Systems parts work. If you'd like to learn more about the four energy healing modalities I'm attuned to and what I'm offering, please click the video below! Love you!</p>

        <article class="placard quote"><p>“Tyler is an extraordinary healer and a deeply intuitive guide. He is lighthearted and playful, his heart is pure, and his spiritual wisdom runs deep. He speaks truth with clarity and compassion, making his guidance easy to receive and integrate. The healing frequencies that move through him are profoundly powerful—truly beyond words. They must be experienced to be understood. Working with Tyler is both grounding and expansive. I feel safe, seen, and deeply supported in his presence, and I trust him completely to walk with me on my healing journey.” <span class="by">– Karina Z</span></p></article>
        <article class="placard quote"><p>“I met Tyler at an energy healing circle, and immediately felt comfortable in his presence. He brings such an open heart and grounded energy into his practice that makes you feel at ease and safe. Tyler has this intuitive gift of knowing what you need in that moment of his energy work. This gift and his open-hearted presence helps transmute any lower energies, aligning your energy with love and helps bring you into an open-hearted presence of grounded peace and inner alignment. It's truly a gift to receive his healing energy!” <span class="by">– Stacey B</span></p></article>
        <article class="placard quote"><p>“When you look for energy work, the energy & intention of the practitioner is paramount. Tyler is full of love & tenderness & compassion, which is an outpouring of love for humanity & life at large. (Not a creepy, ego-driven, ‘shaman’ who wants your money & your devotion—you may know & fear the type). He has developed his practice through a unique/personal mix of traditions & insight/inner work. The blessings he has given me have connected me to/put me in touch with an ancient, powerful, confident version of myself that had been lost/was not so present within me. And his work absolutely arises from/is connected to your being, which means he is coming to you with presence—co-creating your healing with you/personalizing your experience. Love & healing to you all.” <span class="by">– Megan H</span></p></article>
        <article class="placard quote"><p>“Tyler’s healing experience is one of the most refreshing invigorating clearest experiences I’ve accessed on my healing path. I seek him out anytime I need an upgrade—his touch always delivers.” <span class="by">– Steve Schneider</span></p></article>
        <article class="placard quote"><p>“Tyler is a natural healer. His loving presence and ability to connect to divine healing energy is profound. I have had the lucky opportunity to work with and alongside Tyler many times. He has always been a grounding and loving presence to the community he serves as well as for myself. Anyone with the lucky opportunity to work with Tyler will no doubt experience his extraordinary healing gifts and loving heart.” <span class="by">– Michelle K</span></p></article>
